# Website Sans JavaScript

This website building exercise was inspired by an NDC Oslo Presentation titled "Your website does not need JavaScript" by Amy Kapers.

To learn more about Amy's mad website skills and what she's up to see [AmySKapers.dev](https://kapers.dev).

## Overview

Amy's presentation overviewed an interesting set of HTML and CSS capabilities - stuff that usually developers would consider implementing through JavaScript.

My interest was piqued so I took some time out to explore implementing a website using only HTML and CSS.

There is nothing too serious about this website, it is really a personal, professional exercise for myself.
