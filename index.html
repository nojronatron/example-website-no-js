          This website was designed and built by
          <a href="https://github.com/nojronatron">Nojronatron</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          This website design and build was inspired by a presentation at NDC
          Oslo where Amy Kapers discussed the many capabilities of HTML and CSS,
          without the use of JavaScript. I decided to take on the challenge of
          building a website without JavaScript, and this is the result. Along
          the way I added some other features such as responsive design -- just
          trying to have fun and keep my skills warm.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are no plans to take this website to any special place. It is
          simply a &quot;Can I do this?&quot; challenge to myself.
        </p>
        <p>Enjoy!</p>

        <h1>About Jon</h1>
        <p>
          Hi, my name is Jon and I am a software developer, focused on
          full-stack software development in languages like C# and JavaScript,
          using frameworks like .NET MAUI, Blazor, React, and Node.
        </p>
        <p>
          My passion is in finding simple solutions to high friction problems
          such as user experience, or interactions between systems so that users
          can get things done. I enjoy building for Mobile, Web, and Desktop
          platforms -- whatever makes the most sense to the users and the
          problem at hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having taken a unique path to software development, I bring
          experiences of a systems administrator, a computer network technician,
          and a software test engineer into my designs and solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          On a regular basis, I challenge myself to learn new techniques and
          language details to constantly improve myself versus the day before.
          This website is an example of that.
